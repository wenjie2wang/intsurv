# intsurv 0.2.1

## Minor changes

- Moved C++ header files to `inst/include/` so that they can be linked by other
  packages.
- Added testing suite with help of the tinytest package.
- Adjusted default maximum number of iterations in M-steps for possibly faster
  convergence in function `cox_cure` and `cox_cure_net`.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed weight indices in function `cIndex`.


# intsurv 0.2.0

## New features

  right-censored data with possible uncertain event status.
- Added function `cIndex` for computing concordance index with possible weights.
- Added function `simData4cure` for simulating survival data with possible
  uncertain event status.
