\arguments{
\item{surv_formula}{A formula object starting with \code{~} for the model
formula in survival model part.  For Cox model, no intercept term is
included even if an intercept is specified or implied in the model
formula.  A model formula with an intercept term only is not allowed.}

\item{cure_formula}{A formula object starting with \code{~} for the model
formula in incidence model part.  For logistic model, an intercept term
is included by default and can be excluded by adding \code{+ 0} or
\code{- 1} to the model formula.}

\item{time}{A numeric vector for the observed survival times.}

\item{event}{A numeric vector for the event indicators, where \code{NA}'s
are allowed and represent uncertain event indicators.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame, list, or environment that contains the
model covariates and response variables (\code{time} and \code{event})
If they are not found in data, the variables are taken from the
environment of the specified formula, usually the environment from which
this function is called.}

\item{subset}{An optional logical vector specifying a subset of observations
to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{contrasts}{An optional list, whose entries are values (numeric
matrices or character strings naming functions) to be used as
replacement values for the contrasts replacement function and whose
names are the names of columns of data containing factors.  See
\code{contrasts.arg} of \code{\link[stats]{model.matrix.default}} for
details.}

\item{cv_nfolds}{A nonnegative integer representing the number of folds in
cross-validation.}

\item{surv_net, cure_net}{Optional lists or \code{cox_cure_net.penalty}
objects specifying the elastic penalties for survival model part and
cure rate model part, respectively.}

\item{surv_mstep, cure_mstep}{A named list passed to \code{cox_cure.mstep()}
specifying the control parameters for the corresponding M-steps.}

\item{control}{A \code{cox_cure.control} object that contains the control
parameters.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to the control functions for backward
compatibility.}

\item{surv_x}{A numeric matrix for the design matrix of the survival model
component.}

\item{cure_x}{A numeric matrix for the design matrix of the cure rate model
component.  The design matrix should exclude an intercept term unless we
want to fit a model only including the intercept term.  In that case, we
need further set \code{cure_intercept = FALSE} to not standardize the
intercept term.}

\item{cure_intercept}{A logical value specifying whether to add an intercept
term to the cure rate model component.  If \code{TRUE} by default, an
intercept term is included.}

\item{nlambda}{A positive integer representing the number of lambda
parameters.}

\item{lambda_min_ratio}{A positive number specifying the ratio between the
smallest lambda in the solution path to the large enough lambda that
would result in all zero estimates with the lasso penalty.}

\item{alpha}{A positive number between 0 and 1 representing the mixing
parameter in the elastic net penalty.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric vector that consists of nonnegative values
representing the sequence of the lambda parameters.}

\item{penalty_factor}{A numeric vector that consists of nonnegative penalty
factors (or adaptive weights) for the L1-norm of the coefficient
estimates.}

\item{varying_active}{A logical value.  If \code{TRUE} (by default), the
underlying coordinate-descent algorithm will be iterated over varying
active sets, which can usually improve the computational efficiency when
the number of predictors is large.  Otherwise, an ordinary
coordinate-descent will be performed.}
}
\value{
A \code{cox_cure} or \code{cox_cure_net} object that contains the
    fitted ordinary or regularized Cox cure rate model if none of the event
    indicators is \code{NA}.  For right-censored data with uncertain/missing
    event indicators, a \code{cox_cure_uncer} or \code{cox_cure_net_uncer}
    is returned.
}
\description{
For right-censored data, the function \code{cox_cure_net()} trains a
regularized Cox cure rate model with elastic-net penalty following Masud et
al. (2018), and Zou and Hastie (2005).  For right-censored data with
missing/uncertain event/censoring indicators, it fits the Cox cure rate
model proposed by Wang et al. (2023).
}
\details{
The model estimation procedure follows expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm.  Variable selection procedure through regularization by elastic
net penalty is developed based on cyclic coordinate descent and
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm.
