\arguments{
\item{surv_formula}{A formula object starting with \code{~} for the model
formula in survival model part.  For Cox model, no intercept term is
included even if an intercept is specified or implied in the model
formula.  A model formula with an intercept term only is not allowed.}

\item{cure_formula}{A formula object starting with \code{~} for the model
formula in cure rate model part.  For logistic model, an intercept term
is included by default and can be excluded by adding \code{+ 0} or
\code{- 1} to the model formula.}

\item{time}{A numeric vector for the observed survival times.}

\item{event}{A numeric vector for the event indicators.  \code{NA}'s are
allowed and represent uncertain event status.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame, list, or environment that contains the
covariates and response variables (\code{time} and \code{event}),
included in the model. If they are not found in data, the variables are
taken from the environment of the specified formula, usually the
environment from which this function is called.}

\item{subset}{An optional logical vector specifying a subset of observations
to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{contrasts}{An optional list, whose entries are values (numeric
matrices or character strings naming functions) to be used as

\code{contrasts.arg} of \code{\link[stats]{model.matrix.default}} for
details.}

\item{surv_lambda}{A numeric vector consists of non-negative values
representing the tuning parameter sequence for the survival model part.}

\item{surv_alpha}{A number between 0 and 1 for tuning the elastic net
penalty for the survival model part.  If it is one, the elastic penalty
will reduce to the well-known lasso penalty.  If it is zero, the ridge
penalty will be used.}

\item{surv_nlambda}{A positive number specifying the number of
\code{surv_lambda} if \code{surv_lambda} is not specified.  The default
value is 10.}

\item{surv_lambda_min_ratio}{The ratio of the minimum \code{surv_lambda} to
the large enough \code{surv_lambda} that produces all-zero estimates on
log scale.  The default value is \code{1e-1}.}

\item{surv_l1_penalty_factor}{A numeric vector that consists of positive
numbers for penalty factors (or weights) on L1-norm for the coefficient
estimate vector in the survival model part.  The penalty is applied to
the coefficient estimate divided by the specified weights.  The
specified weights are re-scaled internally so that their summation
equals the length of coefficients.  If it is left unspecified, the
weights are all set to be one.}

\item{cure_lambda}{A numeric vector consists of non-negative values
representing the tuning parameter sequence for the cure model part.}

\item{cure_alpha}{A number between 0 and 1 for tuning the elastic net
penalty for the cure model part.  If it is one, the elastic penalty will
reduce to the well-known lasso penalty.  If it is zero, the ridge
penalty will be used.}

\item{cure_nlambda}{A positive number specifying the number of
\code{cure_lambda} if \code{cure_lambda} is not specified.  The default
value is 10.}

\item{cure_lambda_min_ratio}{The ratio of the minimum \code{cure_lambda} to
the large enough \code{cure_lambda} that produces all-zero estimates on
log scale.  The default value is \code{1e-1}.}

numbers for penalty factors (or weights) on L1-norm for the coefficient
estimate vector in the cure model part.  The penalty is applied to the
coefficient estimate divided by the specified weights.  The specified
weights are re-scaled internally so that their summation equals the
length of coefficients.  If it is left unspecified, the weights are all
set to be one.}

\item{surv_start}{An optional numeric vector representing the starting
values for the Cox model component.  If not specified, the starting
values will be obtained from fitting a regular Cox model to events only.}

\item{cure_start}{An optional numeric vector representing the starting
values for the logistic model component.  If not specified, the starting
values will be obtained from fitting a regular logistic model to the
non-missing event indicators.}

\item{surv_standardize}{A logical value specifying whether to standardize
the covariates for the survival model part.  If \code{FALSE}, the
covariates will be standardized internally to have mean zero and
standard deviation one.}

\item{cure_standardize}{A logical value specifying whether to standardize
the covariates for the cure rate model part.  If \code{TRUE} (by
default), the covariates will be standardized internally to have mean
zero and standard deviation one.}

\item{em_max_iter}{A positive integer specifying the maximum iteration
number of the EM algorithm.  The default value is \code{200}.}

\item{em_rel_tol}{A positive number specifying the tolerance that determines
the convergence of the EM algorithm in terms of the convergence of the
covariate coefficient estimates.  The tolerance is compared with the
relative change between estimates from two consecutive iterations, which
is measured by ratio of the L1-norm of their difference to the sum of
their L1-norm.  The default value is \code{1e-5}.}

\item{surv_max_iter}{A positive integer specifying the maximum iteration
number of the M-step routine related to the survival model component.

component in terms of the convergence of the covariate coefficient
estimates.  The tolerance is compared with the relative change between
estimates from two consecutive iterations, which is measured by ratio of
the L1-norm of their difference to the sum of their L1-norm.  The
default value is \code{1e-5}.}

\item{cure_max_iter}{A positive integer specifying the maximum iteration
number of the M-step routine related to the cure rate model component.
The default value is \code{10} to encourage faster convergence.}

\item{cure_rel_tol}{A positive number specifying the tolerance that
determines the convergence of the M-step related to the cure rate model
component in terms of the convergence of the covariate coefficient
estimates.  The tolerance is compared with the relative change between
estimates from two consecutive iterations, which is measured by ratio of
the L1-norm of their difference to the sum of their L1-norm.  The
default value is \code{1e-5}.}

\item{tail_completion}{A character string specifying the tail completion
method for conditional survival function.  The available methods are
\code{"zero"} for zero-tail completion after the largest event times (Sy
and Taylor, 2000), \code{"exp"} for exponential-tail completion (Peng,
2003), and \code{"zero-tau"} for zero-tail completion after a specified
\code{tail_tau}.  The default method is the zero-tail completion
proposed by Sy and Taylor (2000).}

\item{tail_tau}{A numeric number specifying the time of zero-tail
completion.  It will be used only if \code{tail_completion =
"zero-tau"}.  A reasonable choice must be a time point between the
largest event time and the largest survival time.}

\item{pmin}{A numeric number specifying the minimum value of probabilities
for sake of numerical stability.  The default value is \code{1e-5}.}

\item{early_stop}{A logical value specifying whether to stop the iteration
once the negative log-likelihood unexpectedly increases, which may
suggest convergence on likelihood, or indicate numerical issues or
implementation bugs.  The default value is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value.  If \code{TRUE}, a verbose information will
be given along iterations for tracing the convergence.  The default
value is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments for future usage.  A warning will be thrown if
any invalid argument is specified.}

\item{surv_x}{A numeric matrix for the design matrix of the survival model
component.}

\item{cure_x}{A numeric matrix for the design matrix of the cure rate model
component.  The design matrix should exclude an intercept term unless we
want to fit a model only including the intercept term.  In that case, we
need further set \code{cure_intercept = FALSE} to not standardize the
intercept term.}

\item{cure_intercept}{A logical value specifying whether to add an intercept
term to the cure rate model component.  If \code{TRUE} by default, an
intercept term is included.}

\description{
For right-censored data, fit a regularized Cox cure rate model through
elastic-net penalty following Masud et al. (2018), and Zou and Hastie
(2005).  For right-censored data with uncertain event status,
fit the regularized Cox cure model proposed by Wang et al. (2019+).  Without
regularization, the model reduces to the regular Cox cure rate model (Kuk
and Chen, 1992; Sy and Taylor, 2000)
}
\details{
The model estimation procedure follows expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm.  Variable selection procedure through regularization by elastic
net penalty is developed based on cyclic coordinate descent and
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm.
