\description{
The function fits the integrative Cox model proposed by Wang (2017+) for
uncertain survival data due to imperfect data integration. The maximization
of the observed-data likelihood function follows expectation conditional
maximization (ECM) algorithm proposed by Meng (1993).
}
\details{
The argument \code{start} is an optional list that allows users to specify
starting value of each parameter in the model. The valid named elements are
given as follows:
\itemize{

\item \code{beta}: A numeric vector for starting values of coefficient
    estimates. The default values are the coefficient estimates from the
    regular Cox model only fitting on records without uncertainty.  If
    censoring rate among subjects having unique certain records is extremely
    high (> 0.99) or \code{\link[survival]{coxph}} returns any warning, such
    as perfect seperation problem between event indicator and one predictor,
    the starting values will be all zeros by default.

\item \code{censorRate}: A positive numeric vector taking values between 0
    and 1. If a vector of length more than one is given, multiple starting
    values on prior probabilities are applied. In each initialization,
    individual value in the vector is taken as parameter in the multinomial
    distribution indicating the prior probability of censoring record being
    true.  The remaining probability mass is equally assigned to the
    possible event records. For example, when \code{censorRate = 1} is
    specified, the extended model reduces to the regular Cox model fitting
    data before matching, which takes all the censoring records as true. On
    the contrary, when \code{censorRate = 0} is specified, the model does
    not take possible censoring records into account.  If \code{multiStart =
    FALSE}, the default value of \code{censorRate} is the sample censoring
    rate among subjects having records without uncertainty.

\item \code{piVec}: A numeric vector specifying the prior probability of
    each original record being true. The length of the vector has to be the
    same with number of rows of the data input. The values should be between
    0 and 1. By default, \code{censorRate} is used to generate appropriate
    prior probabilities.

\item \code{multiStart}: A logical value specifying whether multiple
    starting values of \code{censorRate} is needed. The argument is ignored
    when explicit \code{censorRate} or \code{piVec} is specified. The
    default value is \code{FALSE} for less computation time. However,
    enabling multiple starting values \code{multiStart = TRUE} is suggested
    to reduce the influence of possible local maximizer. If \code{TRUE},
    \code{censorRate} takes a grid from 0 to 1 with step 0.02 by default.

}

The argument \code{control} is an optional list that allows users to control
the process of ECM algorithm and each conditional maximization (CM) step.
The valid named elements are given as follows:
\itemize{

\item \code{gradtol}: A positive scalar giving the tolerance at which the
    scaled gradient is considered close enough to zero to terminate each CM
    step. The default value is \code{1e-6}.

\item \code{stepmax}: A positive scalar that gives the maximum allowable
    scaled step length for each CM step.  The default value is \code{1e2}.

\item \code{steptol}: A positive scalar providing the minimum allowable
    relative step length for each CM step.  The default value is
    \code{1e-6}.

\item \code{iterlim}: A positive integer specifying the maximum number of
    iterations to be performed before each CM is terminated. The default
    value is \code{1e2}.

\item \code{steptol_ECM}: A positive scalar that specifies the maximum
    allowable relative step size between each ECM iteration.  The default
    value is \code{1e-4}.

\item \code{iterlim_ECM}: A positive integer specifying the maximum number
    of iterations to be performed before the ECM algorithm is
    terminated. The default value is \code{1e2}.

\item \code{commonCenRate}: If \code{TRUE}, the algorithm keeps a same
    probability for all the uncertain censoring cases to be the truth; If
    \code{FASLE}, it allows different probabilities for censoring cases to
    be the truth.

}
Internally, the first four named elements are passed to function
\code{\link[stats]{nlm}}.
